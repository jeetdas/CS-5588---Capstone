## Project Description: Enhanced Retrieval and Generation System for Civil Engineering Reference Manuals

The project is designed to change the way civil engineers and professionals access critical information within extensive reference manuals. Traditional manuals, often spanning thousands of pages and encompassing various forms of media, present a formidable challenge when searching for specific details promptly. This project aims to address this hurdle by developing an end-to-end system powered by cutting-edge technology.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive system that empowers civil engineers and related personnel to efficiently retrieve essential information from vast and intricate reference manuals. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), users will be able to submit queries in natural language. The system will then employ advanced retrieval techniques, augmented with generation, to extract and present essential information in an easily understandable format.

## Key Features
- Natural Language Querying: Users can input questions using everyday language, streamlining the search process.
- Information Retrieval and Generation: The system combines information retrieval and generation techniques to extract accurate answers from dense reference materials.
- Customizable Responses: Optionally, the system can tailor responses based on user-defined parameters, offering personalized outputs.
- Easy Integration: The system will be provided as an API, enabling seamless integration into existing workflows.

## Target Audience
This project caters to civil engineers and professionals working within the domain, providing them with a powerful tool to access vital information within reference manuals swiftly.

## Unique Selling Points
This project's innovation lies in its ability to conquer the challenges posed by unwieldy reference manuals. By offering a rapid and accurate means of retrieval, the system is poised to save significant time and effort for users, ultimately enhancing productivity and decision-making.

## Technologies Utilized
The project utilizes decoder-style large language models, such as the GPT family, for text generation. Vector databases store vectorized documents, while FastAPI facilitates the delivery of information through a user-friendly REST API. Explorations into the applications of encoder-style LLMs (like BERT) for information retrieval and the integration of fine-tuned LLMs for specific tasks are also planned.

## Project Deliverables
The project will culminate in the creation of an accessible API that enables users to seamlessly query extensive reference documents and receive concise, relevant responses.

## Team
The project is led by Jeet Das, who is responsible for the system's development, implementation, and deployment. I am currently a PhD student under Dr. Shu-Ching Chen and this project is in collaboration with him.

As the project progresses, milestones and timelines will be established to ensure steady progress and successful achievement of the project's objectives.
